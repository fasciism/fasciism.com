<p>
Normally <code>&lt;backspace&gt;</code> is bound to <code>backward-delete-char-untabify</code>, meaning that if you have the cursor to the right of a tab, and then backspace, it will convert the tab into 8 spaces and remove one. I don't find that intuitive. I'd prefer that backspace delete a single character, whatever it may be.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span style="color: #2aa198;">"&lt;backspace&gt;"</span>) 'backward-delete-char)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I'd also like to be able to tell if a file is indented with tabs or spaces. I like tabs for indentation, and spaces for alignment, personally. Let's enable <code>whitespace-mode</code>, allowing us to see a variety of whitespace-related issues:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> whitespace-style '(face trailing tabs empty space-after-tab tab-mark))
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'whitespace-mode)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'whitespace-mode)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now we will see tabs as <code>Â»</code>, and trailing spaces and lines in the file will appear red.
</p>

<p>
By default, <code>M-SPC</code> turns a run of whitespace into a single space, and <code>M-\</code> turns a run of whitespace into nothing. It's more useful to have a single key binding for this that cycles through those options, and back to nothing.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(global-set-key (kbd <span style="color: #2aa198;">"M-SPC"</span>) 'cycle-spacing)
</pre>
</div>
