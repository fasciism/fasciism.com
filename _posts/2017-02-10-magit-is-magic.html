I stopped doing development for a living three years ago, having moved into security consulting and penetration testing since. Now that I'm setting up Emacs again, I can't believe how much I have missed <a href="https://magit.vc/">Magit</a>. While Org-mode and Gnus are the main killer apps for Emacs, they are sprawling. Magit is extremely fast, tight, focused, and beautiful. As mentioned <a href="http://fasciism.com/2017/02/09/cue-ball/">yesterday</a>, I have been doing some open source development recently, and one thing I believe in when making contributions to the code of others is tight diffs. Magit makes it so that the use of a <code>git add -p</code> equivalent is very accessible.

Magit's maintainer is very active, new releases are frequent. I love Magit so much that I contribute to the <a href="https://www.patreon.com/tarsius">maintainer's Patreon</a>. It's really that good.
