There are many great choices for the first real customization to make to a stock Emacs configuration, but I've chosen one that to me most represents taking the safety off: simplifying confirmations via <code>yes-or-no-p</code>. Lisp has a tradition of using the <code>p</code>-suffix to denote predicates, statements which can be either true or false. Emacs's offers excellent built-in help facilities, one of which searches the documentation of symbols (i.e., docstrings) for a pattern. Using this help facility, called <code>apropos-documentation</code> (<code>C-h d yes-or-no-p</code>), describes the function of interest as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(yes-or-no-p PROMPT)
</p>

<p>
Ask user a yes-or-no question. Return t if answer is yes, and nil if the answer is no. PROMPT is the string to display to ask the question. It should end in a space; =yes-or-no-p' adds "(yes or no) " to it.
</p>

<p>
The user must confirm the answer with RET, and can edit it until it has been confirmed.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
Typing <code>yes</code> and <code>no</code> quickly becomes tiresome. Thankfully there's <code>y-or-n-p</code>, described as:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
(y-or-n-p PROMPT)
</p>

<p>
Ask user a "y or n" question. Return t if answer is "y". PROMPT is the string to display to ask the question. It should end in a space; `y-or-n-p' adds "(y or n) " to it.
</p>

<p>
No confirmation of the answer is requested; a single character is enough. SPC also means yes, and DEL means no.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This feels dangerous, but Emacs has great undo capabilities and the convenience is appreciable, so let's pull the trigger.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The reason that I've used <code>fset</code> above is that symbols have separate function and value cells, similar to how Lisp uses address (<code>car</code>) and data (<code>cdr</code>) cells.
