Just a minor configuration change today. I've noticed that when I trigger URLs in Emacs in various modes my web browser doesn't pop up properly. I've looked at a few options for fixing this, and the most straightforward one is this:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-generic
      browse-url-generic-program <span style="color: #2aa198;">"firefox"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
That is all. Good day to you.
