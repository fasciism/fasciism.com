One nice feature I've experienced in some Vim installations is the editor remembering where my cursor was the last time I viewed a file. Emacs can do that, too:

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq save-place-file "~/.emacs.d/saved-point-places"
      save-place-forget-unreadable-files nil)
(save-place-mode t)
</pre>
</div>
