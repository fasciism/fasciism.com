I have just realized tonight that I've been sitting on all kinds of posts that I thought I'd already published. Expect updates, finally!

When I have to be away from my beloved Kinesis Advantage 2, with its glorious blank keycaps and Dvorak keymap, I find myself on one of two MacBooks for work. As many others have noted, the Caps Lock key is a pox upon keyboard everywhere, and I universally rebind it to Control:

</p>
</div>

My muscle memory on normal, lame keyboard also expects to find Alt (Meta) just to the left of the space bar, to I take care of that with a bit of Elisp:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> mac-command-key-is-meta t)
(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> mac-command-modifier 'meta)

(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> mac-option-key-is-meta nil)
(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> mac-option-modifier nil)
</pre>
</div>
