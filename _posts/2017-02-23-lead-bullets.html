<p>
I'm punting it today due to time constraints. Here's a short bit of Org-mode configuration that I've seen other places and have adopted.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">org-bullets</span>
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:ensure</span> t
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:pin</span> melpa-stable
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:config</span>
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">lambda</span> ()
                             (org-bullets-mode 1))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This package changes the bullets used by Org-mode to make them visibly different at different levels. I've kept the default set of bullets provided by the package for the moment, but that may change as I start to use Org-mode more heavily.
</p>

<p>
Another important change is telling Org-mode to hide leading bullets in headers so that you don't see five bullets prefixing a fifth-level header:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> org-hide-leading-stars t)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's important to note that even with these changes, the actual text representation of the heading doesn't change: the file still has the same asterisks as always underneath it all. This is especially important for me, since I frequently write parts of emails in Org-mode, and then copy-and-paste them into O365. For now, at least. In the end, these configuration changes result in the following styling:
