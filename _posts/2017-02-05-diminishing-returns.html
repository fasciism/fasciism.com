<p>
For all of the minor modes that I use, I enable them globally. This may change in the future, as can anything, but for now I have no need to know which minor modes are enabled, because the answer is "All the ones I like." Diminish is a package that allows the replacement or omission of mode names in the mode line.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">diminish</span>
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:ensure</span> t
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:pin</span> melpa-stable
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:config</span>
  <span style="color: #586e75;">;; </span><span style="color: #586e75;">Diminish built-in modes we've already enabled.</span>
  (diminish 'flyspell-mode)
  (diminish 'visual-line-mode)
  (diminish 'whitespace-mode))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Since we have not yet installed any new minor modes, we will diminish only those which are part of the base system. In future entries we will use <code>:diminish</code> in <code>use-package</code> to include packages in the list that Diminish affects.
