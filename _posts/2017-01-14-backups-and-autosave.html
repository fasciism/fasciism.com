<p>
Since clearing my configuration, my filesystem has started to drown in <code>*~</code> files and the occasional <code>#*#</code> file. This is a result of Emacs's default safety net, which I do not appreciate.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(setq auto-save-default nil  ; Prevent *~  files
      make-backup-files nil) ; Prevent #*# files
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I'm sure I'll live to regret this. You'll notice that I used the more compact form of setting multiple variables this time. I'm going to stick with that from now on.
