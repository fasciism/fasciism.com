Now that I've been using Gnus for all my personal email, I've been using Message mode a lot. One thing I need to do very frequently is CC or BCC people or groups. For example, I run a few non-profits and frequently have to CC the <code>organizers@</code> list for our group with any email representing the non-profit to keep the other directors informed. While Message mode is awesome because I can simply type in the names of new headers, I would find it slightly more convenient of the headers I commonly use were already there. And if there's one thing Emacs is about, it's making things slightly more convenient:

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> message-default-mail-headers <span style="color: #2aa198;">"Cc: \nBcc: \n"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I also run my own mail server for my extended family since I've gotten <code>kolybabi.com</code> for us. This means that if anything goes wrong with the server, I need to hear about it. So I'll enable debugging on sending mail.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> smtpmail-debug-info t)
</pre>
</div>
