<p>
Emacs uses a number of heuristics to induce structure on buffer text. One of these heuristics is that, by default, a single space is not the end of a sentence, but is an abbreviation. This interpretation of periods prevents Emacs from wrapping text after periods with only a single space.
</p>

<p>
I don't put two spaces after my periods, and I like using word-wrapping.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> sentence-end-double-space nil)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Reading through the variables documentation using the <code>describe-variable</code> help facility (<code>C-h v sentence-end-double-space</code>), we find other variables of interest:
</p>

<p class="verse">
Non-nil means a single space does not end a sentence.<br  />
<br  />
This is relevant for filling.<br  />
</p>

<p>
Filling will be discussed tomorrow, and is known elsewhere as reflowing.
