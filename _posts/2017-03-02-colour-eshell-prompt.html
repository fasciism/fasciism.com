I had never considered before today how to change the colour of some text. I had messed with applying faces to fonts before when making major modes, but I had never looked into styling a specific string. It turns out to be easy:
</p>

<p>
#!+BEGIN<sub>VERSE</sub>
(propertize STRING &amp;rest PROPERTIES)
</p>

<p>
Return a copy of STRING with text properties added.
First argument is the string to copy.
Remaining arguments form a sequence of PROPERTY VALUE pairs for text properties to add to the result.
#!+END<sub>VERSE</sub>
</p>

<p>
We could leave <code>mak::last-command-status</code> alone, and then advise the function to manipulate its output, but that will inevitably confuse me some day when I am debugging something. So we'll just add a simple <code>propertize</code> call to make the exit code of a command even more visible:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">defun</span> <span style="color: #268bd2;">mak::last-command-status</span> ()
  (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">interactive</span>)
  (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">let</span> ((c eshell-last-command-status))
    (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">when</span> (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">and</span> c (not (eq 0 c)))
      (propertize (format <span style="color: #2aa198;">"?%d "</span> c) 'face '(<span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:foreground</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">"red"</span>)))))
</pre>
</div>
