I have been in love with the <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> colour scheme(s) since I first laid eyes on them. Before I found Solarized, I would always opt for harsh, high-contrast colour schemes consisting solely of bright colours on black backgrounds. What I like about Solarized is that it claims to be non-arbitrary. Most colour schemes have the feel that everything was picked because the author just liked the look of it. Solarized appears to have some method, though not one which I can understand. So, in summary, SCIENCE!
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">solarized-theme</span>
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:ensure</span> t

  (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> solarized-distinct-fringe-background t
        solarized-use-variable-pitch nil
        solarized-high-contrast-mode-line t
        x-underline-at-descent-line t)
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:config</span>
  (load-theme 'solarized-light)
  (load-theme 'solarized-dark))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
First, an explanation of the reason I load the light and then the dark version of Solarized. I do this so that both themes are 'approved' by Emacs, meaning that in <code>~/.emacs.p/custom.el</code> &#x2013; where I store my Customization settings, see <a href="http://fasciism.com/2017/01/02/literate-configuration/">Day 2</a> &#x2013; the hashes for the themes are stored as follows:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(custom-set-variables
 '(custom-safe-themes
   (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">quote</span>
    (<span style="color: #2aa198;">"&lt;hash-for-solarized-light&gt;"</span> <span style="color: #2aa198;">"&lt;hash-for-solarized-dark&gt;"</span> default))))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
This means that whenever I choose to switch between the two versions of the theme, due to the lighting in the environment or the content of a buffer, I needn't worry about warning dialogs. The rest of the settings ensure that Solarized doesn't visually affect other aspects of the Emacs instance.
