<p>
Once thing you start running into when you have many buffers is colliding names. For instance, if I open up two files <code>~/foo/test</code> and <code>~/bar/test</code> I would have two buffers named <code>test&lt;1&gt;</code> and <code>test&lt;2&gt;</code>. This depends on the version of Emacs, but is not very attractive.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">require</span> '<span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">uniquify</span>)
(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> uniquify-buffer-name-style 'post-forward
      uniquify-separator <span style="color: #2aa198;">"::"</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now those two buffers would be named <code>test::foo</code> and <code>test::bar</code>, which I find more palatable.
