<p>
I have noticed the configurations of many others use a function similar to the one below to add some intelligence to moving to the start of a line. It seems like a good idea.

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun mak::cycle-bol-boi ()
  "Cycle between beginning of line and beginning of indentation."
  (interactive)
  (let ((orig (point)))
    (back-to-indentation)
    (when (= orig (point))
      (move-beginning-of-line 1))))

(global-set-key (kbd "C-a") 'mak::cycle-bol-boi)
(global-set-key (kbd "&lt;home&gt;") 'mak::cycle-bol-boi)
</pre>
</div>
