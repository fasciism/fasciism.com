One thing that started bugging me immediately upon using Gnus was the prompt for how many messages I wanted to load from my inbox when it had more than 200 messages in it. It turns out that this behaviour is controlled by <code>gnus-large-newsgroup</code>, described as:
</p>

<p class="verse">
The number of articles which indicates a large newsgroup.<br  />
<br  />
If the number of articles in a newsgroup is greater than this value, confirmation is required for selecting the newsgroup.<br  />
<br  />
If it is nil, no confirmation is required.<br  />
</p>

<p>
So let's stop this right now:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> gnus-large-newsgroup nil)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Now I feel less like Gnus is judging me for the size of my inbox.
