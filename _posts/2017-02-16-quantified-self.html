One thing I've always liked about the Windows Add/Remove Programs interface is that it provides you a date that the installed program was last used. When paring down the number of programs on a Windows computer, that date is helpful to gauge whether a program is useful enough to keep around. Since the number of Emacs packages tends to sprawl over time, I have installed the Keyfreq package to track the commands I use:

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">keyfreq</span>
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:ensure</span> t
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:pin</span> melpa-stable
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:init</span>
  (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> keyfreq-file <span style="color: #2aa198;">"~/.emacs.p/keyfreq/statistics"</span>
        keyfreq-file-lock <span style="color: #2aa198;">"~/.emacs.p/keyfreq/lockfile"</span>)
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:config</span>
  (keyfreq-mode 1)
  (keyfreq-autosave-mode 1))
</pre>
</div>

When I first installed this package, I didn't honestly think it would be that useful. But since installing it, I have used its output to appreciate how much my usage of certain commands is changing.
