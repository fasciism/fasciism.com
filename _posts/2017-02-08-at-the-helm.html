No, I couldn't just call this post "Helm". The terrible title I chose called to me, and so I acquiesced.

<p>
We've done three things in the <code>:config</code> section, let's take a moment to discuss each.
</p>

<p>
We've bound <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> (<code>C-i</code> in a terminal) to the command that (usually) expands a candidate in a list of possible completions. Normally the key for this is <code>C-j</code>, but <code>&lt;tab&gt;</code> is traditional and I don't feel that using a different binding adds any value.
</p>

<p>
Fuzzy matching has been enabled, which requires more processing of a list of candidates, but I have used this feature in the past and appreciated it. To explain be example, I can type <code>C-h v hmfm</code> looking for <code>helm-mode-fuzzy-match</code> and the list of candidates will include every variable that matches the regex <code>.*h.*m.*f.*m.*</code>, which is a lot of candidates. As always, if this annoys me later I can disable it effortlessly.
</p>


<p>
When I initially installed Helm, I limited its use to <code>M-x</code>, but found that I enjoyed it a great deal. I have used Interactive Do (Ido) in earlier times, but I like Helm better. There's also Ivy which is the new kid on the block, but until Helm pisses me off someday it has my (fickle) loyalty.
