No, I couldn't just call this post "Helm". The terrible title I chose called to me, and so I acquiesced. Helm is the most invasive package I've installed thus far. It replaces the majority of commands where user input is expected (e.g., <code>C-x b</code>, <code>C-x C-f</code>, <code>C-x k</code>, <code>M-x</code>) with its own version. Helms commands offer lists of candidates, shown in a pop-up window, which can be filtered, navigated, and selected. This is far more powerful than the default commands, and I find it useful.

<p>
An instance of <code>C-x C-f</code> (<code>helm-find-files</code>) appears as follows:

</p>

Now let's get that package in the system.
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">use-package</span> <span style="color: #268bd2; font-weight: bold;">helm</span>

  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:pin</span> melpa-stable
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:diminish</span> helm-mode
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:bind</span>
  (<span style="color: #2aa198;">"M-x"</span> . helm-M-x)
  (<span style="color: #2aa198;">"C-x C-f"</span> . helm-find-files)
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:init</span>
  (<span style="color: #859900; font-weight: bold;">setq</span> helm-mode-fuzzy-match t)
  <span style="color: #839496; font-weight: bold;">:config</span>
  (helm-mode 1))
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Fuzzy matching has been enabled, which requires more processing of a list of candidates, but I have used this feature in the past and appreciated it. To explain be example, I can type <code>C-h v hmfm</code> looking for <code>helm-mode-fuzzy-match</code> and the list of candidates will include every variable that matches the regex <code>.*h.*m.*f.*m.*</code>, which is a lot of candidates. As always, if this annoys me later I can disable it effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
When I initially installed Helm, I limited its use to <code>M-x</code>, but found that I enjoyed it a great deal. I have used Interactive Do (Ido) in earlier times, but I like Helm better. There's also Ivy which is the new kid on the block, but until Helm pisses me off someday it has my (fickle) loyalty.
