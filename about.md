Back in the early 2000s I fell in love with <a href="http://everything2.com/title/fASCIIsm">Everything2</a>, eventually spending the vast majority of my waking hours reading it through. One post that always stuck with me was about <a href="http://everything2.com/title/fASCIIsm">fASCIIsm</a>, describing it partly as follows:

<pre>
Similar to Fascism, although derived specifically around the
belief that the ASCII character set is theoretically perfect
and an ideal standard for written communication.

* fASCIIsm does not approve of HTML e-mail or any other kind
  of styled e-mail.
* fASCIIsm does not endorse the replacement of emoticons
  with pictorial icons.
* fASCIIsm is mono-spaced.
* fASCIIsm holds the idea of ASCII characters as the highest
  ideal of communication, there has never before in human
  history been a more pure expression of letters.
</pre>

While I don't actually ascribe to that philosophy (I mean, c'mon, Unicode!), I still liked it. And so in 2012 I bought this domain with the plan to write a blog about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs">Emacs</a>. I'm just a little late...
